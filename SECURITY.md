## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send an e-mail to vivimice@gmail.com with a description of:

- a brief description of the vulnerability
- how the vulnerability can be observed
- optionally the type of vulnerability and any related OWASP category
- non-destructive exploitation details

## Followup

Upon submission of your vulnerability report, an acknowledgement response will be promptly issued.

The reported vulnerability will thereafter be triaged, and a response will be generated as quickly as possible to indicate if additional information is needed, if the vulnerability falls within or beyond the project scope, or if it is a duplicate submission. Bug fixes or mitigations are prioritized based on the severity of the impact and the complexity of the exploit.

Upon resolution or scheduling of correction work for the reported vulnerability, you will be notified and requested to ascertain whether the proposed solution addresses the vulnerability sufficiently.

In cases where a report is deemed valid, you will be asked to verify the specifics you wish to be disclosed prior to their publication.

Please note that this project is maintained during spare time, thus the response time and the fix time cannot be guaranteed. However, every effort is made to maintain the security of this project.
